# Introduction

Obelisk is a WebAPI template built in ASP.Net and used in hundreds of succesful One Beyond projects. Obelisk in it's current .NET (Core) form has been in development and production use since early 2018 and draws on developments dating back to 2014 to accelerate delivery of ASP.Net MVC based projects. The core template is supported by core libraries and scaffolder utilities to accelerate development of SPA based front ends, e2e and load tests.
